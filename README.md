# Anomaly-Detection-in-Python
# Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest

This project demonstrates how to perform anomaly detection using Python and the Isolation Forest algorithm. Anomaly detection is a valuable technique for identifying unusual patterns or outliers in datasets, which has applications in various fields such as fraud detection, network security, and quality control.

## Introduction

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying data points that deviate significantly from the expected normal behavior of a dataset. This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm, a tree-based method that efficiently identifies anomalies by isolating them into smaller partitions.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you need Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

## Usage
Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

cd anomaly-detection-isolation-forest
Run the Python script anomaly_detection.py:

python anomaly_detection.py
The script will generate synthetic data, train an Isolation Forest model, and display the anomalies in a plot.

## Sample Dataset
In this project, a synthetic dataset is generated for demonstration purposes. To apply anomaly detection to your own dataset, replace the synthetic data with your own dataset. Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted and preprocessed as needed.

## Results
The results of the anomaly detection process are visualized in a scatter plot, where anomalies are marked in red and normal data points are marked in blue. Additionally, the anomalies are printed to the console.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements, bug fixes, or additional features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
